Package json files to build and lint custom es6 JS in custom modules using Drupal core's build tools.

Copy the package.json to either the docroot or in individual modules.

Run the commands written in the comments of each file.
./core/node_modules must be installed to use this.

This is based on the repo structure of:
```
|-- /docroot
   |-- /core
   |-- /modules
      |-- /custom
         |-- /MODULE_NAME
```
